Neural Network with Backpropagation
This repository contains the implementation of a neural network with backpropagation for training on the MNIST dataset. The network uses ReLU activation functions and cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification. The backpropagation algorithm is used for updating the network's parameters during training.

Description
In this project, we implement a feedforward neural network from scratch with the following features:

Backpropagation: The gradient of the loss function is calculated using the backpropagation algorithm and used to update the model's weights.
ReLU Activation: The ReLU activation function is used for the hidden layer.
Softmax Output: The softmax activation function is used for the output layer, with cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification.
MNIST Dataset: The network is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits and their labels.

Installation
To run the code, make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
Steps to Run the Code:
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Download the MNIST Dataset:

The MNIST dataset is required for training. If you don't have it, the code will attempt to load it from mnist.pkl.gz. Make sure the file is available in the project directory.

Run the Main Script:

After setting up the dependencies and dataset, you can train the network using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python backprop_main.py
The training process will output the training and testing loss/accuracy for each epoch.

Usage
The train() function in backprop_network.py runs the training loop, applying backpropagation to update the network parameters and monitor performance on both the training and testing datasets.

Training Configuration:
Epochs: Number of iterations over the entire dataset.
Batch Size: The number of training examples used in each forward/backward pass.
Learning Rate: The step size used to update the model parameters during gradient descent.
You can modify these parameters inside the backprop_main.py script as needed.

Testing the Model:
After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a separate test dataset, and the results are printed for each epoch.
